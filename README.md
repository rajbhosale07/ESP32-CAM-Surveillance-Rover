# ESP32-CAM Surveillance Rover

# Overview
This project involves the design and development of a low-cost surveillance rover using the ESP32-CAM module. The rover streams real-time video over Wi-Fi and can be remotely controlled through a web-based interface. The system is designed for applications such as indoor surveillance, remote inspection, and robotics learning.

# Key Features
