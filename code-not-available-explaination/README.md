# Code Not Available — Explanation

The original firmware source code for this project was developed on a teammate’s local system.  
Despite efforts to retrieve it, the original source files are not available at this time.

To ensure transparency and documentation integrity, this repository contains all design artifacts, system diagrams, and test results that explain the project’s logic and implementation outcomes, including:

- Block diagrams of system architecture
- Flowcharts for video streaming and sensor data handling
- Motor control performance screenshots
- UI feedback and interactive controls demonstration

These artifacts demonstrate the project functionality clearly and can be used to reconstruct the firmware if necessary.
