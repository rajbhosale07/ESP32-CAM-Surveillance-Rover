# System Documentation

## Block Diagram
![Block Diagram](Block%20Diagram.jpeg)
**Figure 1:** Overall blockdiagram proposed for the system showing sensor calibration and data acquisition and how the data is processed leading to an obstacle detection and further movement execution based on it. 

## Systme Architectural Design
